## Notes
> Tutorial FOLLOW THROUGH, not one I created myself.
> If you're interested in the tutorial I followed, you can find it here:
> It's a super useful tutorial that gives a indepth look on how to use
> applications to test api's, as well as how to fetch and edit that data
> within your IDE. I ended up using his exact sound file originally for convenience.
> It's very easy to add your own, and I will try doing so and testing it out tonight.
> Used postman instead of boomerang, but they're practically the same.
